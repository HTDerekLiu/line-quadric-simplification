# Line Quadrics

This is a minimal Python implementation to demonstrate how to use _line quadrics_ in mesh simplification, based on the paper "Controlling Quadric Error Simplification with Line Quadrics" by Hsueh-Ti Derek Liu, Mehdi Rahimzadeh, and Victor Zordan, presented at SGP 2025.

To run the demo, one can simply run the example script with
```
python main.py
```
to simplify the input mesh down to a lower resolution.
